# Overview #
wrapper is a Minecraft server wrapper, with a heckton of features I don't use. If you want to see the repository in all it's glory, go to the <a href='https://github.com/benbaptist/minecraft-wrapper/tree/development'>original repo</a> I forked from.

This version of the repo is designed for TeachCraft Servers, and is solely used for the feature of auto-rebooting the server on a crash.

To install, I simply dropped the /wrapper folder into <a href='https://github.com/TeachCraft/TeachCraft-Server/tree/master/wrapper'>TeachCraft-Server here</a>. I also setup a config file <a href='https://github.com/TeachCraft/TeachCraft-Server/blob/master/wrapper.properties.json'>here</a>.

I will maintain this repository in a similar structure to the parent I forked from, adding my fixes here so they can be merged upstream.
